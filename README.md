# The Ray Tracer Challenge - in Lua

This is my implementation of [The Ray Tracer Challenge](http://raytracerchallenge.com/) in the Lua language.

## Run tests

`lua tests/tools/tuple.lua` or whichever file you want to test.

## TODO

- [ ] Update tuple to not key x, y, z, w but instead use metatables. This allows colour to be accessed as `color[1]`
