# The Ray Tracer Challenge - in Lua

This is my implementation of [The Ray Tracer Challenge](http://raytracerchallenge.com/) in the Lua language.

## Run tests

`lua tests/tools/tuple.lua` or whichever file you want to test.

## Notes

This is partly me learning Lua beyond simple basics. So yes, there are a few mixed "styles" of coding in this repo. For example, the structure of Tuple is quite different from that of Matrix. They are both perfectly readable so heyho. I may revisit and unify a particular style.
